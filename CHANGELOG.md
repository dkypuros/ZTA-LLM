## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-28 - 🔒 SECURITY HARDENING RELEASE

### 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES
All critical vulnerabilities from comprehensive security review have been resolved and validated.

#### Show-stopper Fixes (Prevent Stack Breakage)
- **[1-A] Fixed import path issues**: Security-impedance-core modules properly accessible in test suite
- **[1-B] Confirmed Docker entrypoint**: FastAPI wrapper (`wrapper.api`) exists and functional
- **[1-C] Resolved license conflict**: Consistent MIT license across all files (was mixed MIT/GPL-3)

#### Critical Gap Validation Results
- **✅ Gap A: Missing OS Import Fix**
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Issue**: `PathAliaser.alias_path()` called `os.path.normpath` but `os` was not imported
  - **Fix**: Added `import os` to `src/wrapper/path_aliasing.py`
  - **Validation**: Path aliasing works correctly, generates valid aliases (e.g., `FILE_511b36a3`)

- **✅ Gap B: Envoy-OPA Port Alignment**
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Issue**: Port mismatch between Envoy (8181) and OPA (9191) causing auth failures
  - **Fix**: Changed OPA gRPC plugin from `:9191` to `:8181` in `deploy/opa/config/opa-config.yaml`
  - **Validation**: Both configurations now use port 8181 consistently

- **✅ Gap C: MCP Server Error Handling**
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Issue**: Pydantic validation errors returned 500 instead of 400
  - **Fix**: Added `PydanticValidationError` to exception handling in `src/mcp_server/server.py`
  - **Validation**: Proper error handling with correct HTTP status codes

- **✅ Gap D: Docker FastAPI Entrypoint**
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Issue**: Missing `wrapper/api.py` file causing Docker container crash-loop
  - **Fix**: Created FastAPI application with health, process, metrics, and config endpoints
  - **Validation**: FastAPI app successfully created with all required routes

- **✅ Gap E: OPA Policy Source Address**
  - **Status**: PASS
  - **Issue**: OPA policy referenced `input.request.remote_addr` which Envoy doesn't set
  - **Fix**: Changed to `input.source_address` for Envoy compatibility
  - **Validation**: Proper audit logging configuration for forensics

#### Security Vulnerability Closures
- **[2-A] JWT signature security**: Fixed predictable RNG → uses `secrets.token_bytes()` (CSPRNG)
- **[2-B] JWT structure validation**: Fixed base64 padding issues preventing false negatives
- **[2-C] Entropy overlap detection**: Fixed O(n³) sliding window → interval-based overlap checking
- **[2-D] MCP error disclosure**: Fixed stack trace leakage → debug-mode controlled error messages
- **[2-E] Unicode normalization**: Verified prevention of confusable character bypass attacks

#### Performance Improvements
- **[3-B] Non-blocking jitter**: Fixed blocking `time.sleep()` → async-compatible timing jitter
