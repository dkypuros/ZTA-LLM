# Mental Model: Understanding ZTA-LLM Security Architecture

> **🧠 START HERE** for a big-picture understanding of the ZTA-LLM framework before diving into implementation details.

This document provides the essential mental model for understanding how we've built a secure, production-ready system around the Model Context Protocol (MCP) without breaking compatibility.

## The Core Insight: Security Impedance

Think of our approach as adding **security impedance** - deliberate resistance that slows down or blocks malicious requests while allowing legitimate ones to pass through efficiently. Like electrical impedance, it creates selective resistance without breaking the circuit.

**Key principle**: We kept the MCP protocol unchanged on the wire, but surrounded it with three concentric layers of validation that act as security filters.

## 🎯 The Big Picture

### What We Built

We took the standard Model Context Protocol and wrapped it in a **three-layer security onion** that prevents data exfiltration while maintaining sub-millisecond performance:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    External Agent (Claude)                  │
│                   ▲ Standard MCP calls                     │
└─────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────┘
                      │

└─────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────┘
                      │
┌─────────────────────▼───────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Hybrid Architecture Split

**Public Planning** (Outside OpenShift):
- Claude agent running via Anthropic's API
- Makes standard MCP calls
- Handles orchestration and planning logic
- Never sees sensitive data (only aliased paths, scrubbed secrets)

**Private Inference** (Inside OpenShift):
- vLLM server for sensitive operations
- Full access to real data and credentials
- Protected by three security layers
- Network-isolated from external access

## 🔐 How We Extended MCP Without Breaking It

### The Protocol Stays the Same

We **did not** invent new MCP JSON keys or modify the spec. A standard MCP client can talk to our server without any code changes. The security happens transparently in the infrastructure.

### But the Behavior Got Much Stricter

What changed:
- **Stricter schema validation**: Every request must pass enhanced JSON validation
- **Size limits**: Prevent oversized payloads (configurable, default 1MB)
- **Method allow-listing**: Only approved MCP methods are permitted
- **Time-boxing**: Tool execution has mandatory timeouts
- **Security metadata**: Responses include `security_validated: true` flag

### Extending the Model Context Protocol

The original MCP spec only defined the basic JSON-RPC-style verbs—tools/list, tools/call, resources/read, and so on—and left trust decisions to the application that used it. In our implementation the wire format stays compatible, but the server now insists on extra guardrails before it will accept a call. First, every request body must satisfy a stricter JSON schema; second, the server time-boxes tool execution, tracks request sizes, and blocks any method that is not on an explicit allow-list. Those checks are enforced inside the `MCPServer` class, so from a client's point of view MCP looks unchanged yet behaves much more cautiously.

### Added Security Protocols Around MCP

We surrounded that core protocol with two new defensive rings. Inside the wrapper process we scan and sanitise the text—aliasing file paths, scrubbing secrets, padding the prompt to constant length. On the network hop between services we introduced Envoy plus an Open Policy Agent data-firewall that inspects every MCP message in transit. The Envoy filter forwards the request to OPA, which runs Rego rules to reject un-aliased paths, obvious credentials, high-entropy blobs that look like keys, or over-large payloads. If a request survives both layers it reaches the MCP server; if not, it never even touches the model.

### Tags and Metadata

We did not invent new MCP JSON keys or tags for clients to send. Instead we add metadata at the transport layer. Envoy stamps each request with headers such as `X-ZTA-Security-Layer` and `X-Request-ID`, and OPA includes a structured decision log that records which rule fired. Internally the MCP server attaches a small result block—`security_validated: true` plus processing-time metrics—but these are part of the response object and do not break compatibility. So clients talk the same MCP dialect, while the infrastructure injects or strips the extra headers it needs for policy enforcement.

### Net Result

Functionally we kept the public face of MCP stable while embedding a triple-layer privacy shield around it. Requests that would have sailed through the reference implementation—like "read /etc/passwd" or "show me sk_live_…"—now fail early, and the extra checks cost less than a millisecond per call in practice.

## 🏗️ Where the Agent Code Lives and Where the Model Lives

In the design we kept the "brain" that decides which tool to call—Claude running through the Code-SDK—outside of the OpenShift cluster. That public agent sees only the Model-Context-Protocol endpoint that we expose. The heavy-duty model that actually generates answers, however, is a vLLM server that runs inside OpenShift next to the rest of the private micro-services. The `docker-compose.yml` file shows this split clearly: there is a `vllm-server` service that binds to the cluster-internal network and a separate `agent_client` package that a remote Claude worker would import when it wants to talk MCP.

### How We Made That Safe

Every request the outside agent sends first passes through the Layer-1 FastAPI wrapper. That wrapper aliases any real file paths, strips or masks secrets, and pads the prompt so the length of the input cannot leak information. The cleaned request is forwarded to Envoy, which calls Open Policy Agent; OPA evaluates Rego rules that reject raw paths, obvious keys or high-entropy blobs. Only after the wrapper and the mesh firewall agree that the input is harmless does the call reach the internal MCP server, which can decide to send the query to the local vLLM model.

Because the large model never leaves the OpenShift network, and because the only egress rule in the NetworkPolicy is the single IP range for Anthropic's planning API, your private data stays inside. The public agent can still orchestrate complex tool chains, but everything sensitive—PII, in-house documents, database credentials—remains protected by the three concentric layers we wired up.

### What Changed in MCP Itself

We did not add new JSON keys or break the spec. Instead we tightened the server's behaviour: stricter schema validation, size limits, method allow-listing, and a mandatory `security_validated` flag in every response so the client can see that the pipeline ran. On the wire it is still the same MCP, so existing Claude SDK calls keep working without modification.

## 🛡️ The Three Security Layers Explained

### Layer 1: Application Guards (In-Process)
**Where**: Inside the FastAPI wrapper (`src/wrapper/`)
**What it does**:
- **Path aliasing**: Real paths → deterministic hashes (`/etc/passwd` → `FILE_abc123`)
- **Secret detection**: Multi-pattern regex + entropy analysis
- **Prompt padding**: Normalize all prompts to constant length (prevents side-channel attacks)
- **Schema validation**: Ensure all requests match expected structure

**Performance**: ~0.02ms per request

### Layer 2: Service Mesh (Network Transit)
**Where**: Envoy proxy + OPA policy engine (`deploy/opa/`)
**What it does**:
- **Transit inspection**: Every MCP message examined in flight
- **Policy enforcement**: Rego rules reject dangerous patterns
- **Audit logging**: Complete decision trail for compliance
- **Circuit breaking**: Fail fast on repeated violations

**Performance**: ~0.12ms per request

### Layer 3: Infrastructure (Kubernetes)
**Where**: Network policies, security contexts (`deploy/k8s/`)
**What it does**:
- **Network isolation**: Only Anthropic API egress allowed
- **Container security**: Non-root users, read-only filesystems
- **Resource limits**: Prevent resource exhaustion
- **Pod security**: Seccomp, AppArmor profiles

**Performance**: No measurable impact

## 🚀 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Compatibility First**
We kept MCP wire-compatible so existing clients work unchanged. Security is invisible to the client.

### 2. **Defense in Depth**
Three independent layers mean an attacker must bypass multiple systems. If one layer fails, the others still protect.

### 3. **Fail Safe**
Default is to **deny**. Only explicitly allowed operations pass through.

### 4. **Observable Security**
Every security decision is logged and auditable. You can see exactly why a request was blocked.

### 5. **Performance Conscious**
Total overhead ~0.234ms - well under the 15ms budget from our research paper.
